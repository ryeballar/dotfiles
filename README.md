My DOTFILES (~/.)
===

Why?
---

Because I noticed that copying my Custom VIM, GIT, BASH and TMUX configs to work stations or servers took too much effort.

Installation
---
```shell
# NOTE: make sure to install cmake, build-essentials and python-dev on ubuntu/debian
#       for other distros, please install appropriate packages
sh install.sh # seriously, that's it! and follow the prompts!
```
