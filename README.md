My DOTFILES (~/.)
===

Why?
---
Because I noticed that copying my Custom VIM, GIT, BASH and TMUX configs to
work stations or servers took too much effort.

NOTES:
---
- requires: cmake, build-essential, python-dev, tmux
	- run `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential python-dev tmux -y`
- will overwrite any custom VIM configs that you have!
- will overwrite any custom BASHRC configs that you have!
- will overwrite any custom TMUX configs that you have!

Installation
---
```shell
# Install requirements
sh install.sh # seriously, that's it! and follow the prompts!
```
